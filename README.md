Cancer Prediction with Machine Learning 

Objective:
Use ML tools to predict cancer risk, diagnosis, recurrence, or survival from clinical, genomic, imaging, and molecular data.

Key Data Types:

Clinical records & electronic health data

Medical imaging (e.g. mammograms, histopathology, CT/MRI)

Genomic or multi‑omics data

Emerging modalities like liquid biopsies and facial biomarkers

ML Techniques:

Traditional supervised models: logistic regression, random forest, SVM, XGBoost

Deep learning: CNNs for images, DNNs for complex omics datasets

Ensemble models and feature‑selection pipelines for high accuracy and explainability 

Performance & Impact:

Well-developed models often reach 95–99% classification accuracy in breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, and other cancers 

ML can improve prediction accuracy by 15–25% over traditional clinical risk scores 


Explainability & Knowledge Integration:

Techniques like SHAP and other XAI tools are widely used for model interpretability, especially on ensemble methods 


Knowledge‑informed ML approaches that incorporate biomedical domain knowledge help improve reliability and robustness 

Challenges & Considerations:

High‑dimensional data with small sample sizes → risk of overfitting

Data heterogeneity and limited external validation

Ethical and transparency concerns around bias and data privacy
